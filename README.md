#Description
This repository contains a deep learning model built using TensorFlow for classifying tomato diseases. The dataset is sourced from the PlantVillage dataset on Kaggle, and only the tomato data is utilized. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and is trained to differentiate between various tomato plant diseases. Data augmentation techniques and performance optimizations are also applied to improve model accuracy.
#Dataset
The dataset is taken from Kaggle's PlantVillage Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). This project uses only the data related to tomato leaves, which are categorized into the ten classes
#Data Preprocessing
The images were resized to (128, 128) pixels.
Data augmentation techniques like random flipping and rotation were applied to improve the modelâ€™s robustness.
